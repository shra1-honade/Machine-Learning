# Machine Learning Academic Projects Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning Academic Projects Repository! This repository showcases two academic projects: "Airline Cancellation Prediction" and "Traffic Stoppage Analysis."

## Project 1: Airline Cancellation Prediction

### Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts airline cancellations based on selected attributes. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and the development of predictive models using PySpark. Different machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and GBT Classifier, are employed. The models are evaluated using cross-validation and parameter grid search to identify the best-performing model.

### Approach
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Machine Learning Model Development
- Model Evaluation (Cross-Validation and Parameter Grid Search)

### Interpretation
The project includes interpretation of model results and justifications for predictions.

## Project 2: Traffic Stoppage Analysis

### Objective
The main objective of the "Traffic Stoppage Analysis" project is to analyze data collected by the Stanford Open Policing Project. The Stanford Open Policing Project aims to collect, standardize, and release traffic stop and search data from various U.S. police departments. This dataset enables detailed analysis and understanding of racial and ethnic disparities in policing, as well as other issues surrounding police behavior and practices.

### Dataset Details
The data generally includes information about:
- Date and time of the stop
- Location
- Driver's race, gender, and age
- Reason for the stop (e.g., speeding, equipment violation)
- Result of the stop (e.g., warning, citation, arrest)
- Whether a search was conducted and if contraband was found

Coverage:
The dataset covers 31 states, with data from dozens of individual departments. It's worth noting that the availability and granularity of the data can vary across states and departments, based on their respective data collection and reporting practices.

### Approach
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Statistical Analysis
- Visualization Techniques

### Interpretation
The project includes the interpretation of analysis results and insights gained from traffic stoppage data.
