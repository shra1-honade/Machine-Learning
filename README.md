# Traffic-Stoppage-Analysis

Objective: The main objective of the Stanford Open Policing Project is to collect, standardize, and release traffic stop and search data from various U.S. police departments. This dataset enables detailed analysis and understanding of racial and ethnic disparities in policing, as well as other issues surrounding police behavior and practices.

Dataset Details: The data generally includes information about:

Date and time of the stop
Location
Driver's race, gender, and age
Reason for the stop (e.g., speeding, equipment violation)
Reason for the stop (e.g., speeding, equipment violation)
Result of the stop (e.g., warning, citation, arrest)
Whether a search was conducted and if contraband was found
Coverage: The Website includes a dataset covering 31 states, with data from dozens of individual departments. It's worth noting that the availability and granularity of the data can vary across states and departments, based on their respective data collection and reporting practices.

For this project, we chose the San Diego dataset due to the Volume available and the variety of the recorded features.
